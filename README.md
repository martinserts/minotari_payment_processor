# Minotari Payment Processor

The Minotari Payment Processor is a service designed to handle and automate payment processing within the Minotari ecosystem. It integrates with a Tari base node and a Payment Receiver (PR) API to manage payment batches, sign transactions, broadcast them to the network, and confirm their status on-chain.

## Workspaces

This project consists of two main workspaces:

### `minotari-client`

This workspace contains autogenerated client code for interacting with external services.

To regenerate the client code, use the following `make` command:

```sh
make regenerate-client
```

### `minotari_payment_processor`

This is the main executable service of the project.

## Setup and Installation

To get the `minotari_payment_processor` up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Database Setup

First, you need to create and migrate the SQLite database:

```sh
mkdir -p data
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run
```

Database migrations are located in the `migrations` folder.

### 2. Database Schema Regeneration

If the database schema changes, you need to regenerate the documentation in `docs/db/db_schema.sql` using the following command:

```sh
make db-dump
```

## Configuration

The `minotari_payment_processor` is configured using environment variables. These variables can be set in a `.env` file in the project root or directly in your environment.

Below is a list of key environment variables:

*   **`DATABASE_URL`** (Mandatory): The URL for the SQLite database.
    *   Example: `DATABASE_URL="sqlite://data/payments.db"`
*   **`PAYMENT_RECEIVER`** (Mandatory): The URL of the Payment Receiver (PR) API.
    *   Example: `PAYMENT_RECEIVER="http://localhost:9000"`
*   **`BASE_NODE`** (Mandatory): The URL of the Tari Base Node.
    *   Example: `BASE_NODE="https://rpc.esmeralda.tari.com"`
*   **`CONSOLE_WALLET_PATH`** (Mandatory): The path to the `minotari_console_wallet` executable, used for signing transactions.
    *   Example: `CONSOLE_WALLET_PATH="minotari_console_wallet"`
*   **`LISTEN_IP`** (Optional): The IP address the HTTP API server will listen on. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
    *   Example: `LISTEN_IP="0.0.0.0"`
*   **`LISTEN_PORT`** (Optional): The port the HTTP API server will listen on. Defaults to `9145`.
    *   Example: `LISTEN_PORT="9145"`
*   **`BATCH_CREATOR_SLEEP_SECS`** (Optional): The sleep duration in seconds for the Batch Creator worker.
    *   Example: `BATCH_CREATOR_SLEEP_SECS="600"` (10 minutes)
*   **`UNSIGNED_TX_CREATOR_SLEEP_SECS`** (Optional): The sleep duration in seconds for the Unsigned Transaction Creator worker.
    *   Example: `UNSIGNED_TX_CREATOR_SLEEP_SECS="15"`
*   **`TRANSACTION_SIGNER_SLEEP_SECS`** (Optional): The sleep duration in seconds for the Transaction Signer worker.
    *   Example: `TRANSACTION_SIGNER_SLEEP_SECS="10"`
*   **`BROADCASTER_SLEEP_SECS`** (Optional): The sleep duration in seconds for the Broadcaster worker.
    *   Example: `BROADCASTER_SLEEP_SECS="15"`
*   **`CONFIRMATION_CHECKER_SLEEP_SECS`** (Optional): The sleep duration in seconds for the Confirmation Checker worker.
    *   Example: `CONFIRMATION_CHECKER_SLEEP_SECS="60"`

## HTTP API

The service exposes an HTTP API that can be easily browsed using Swagger UI. If you are using the default port, you can access it at:

```
http://localhost:9145/swagger-ui/
```

The API definitions can be found in `minotari_payment_processor/src/api/mod.rs`.

## Background Workers

The `minotari_payment_processor` runs several background workers that perform specific tasks in the payment processing pipeline. Each worker executes its task and then sleeps for a configurable duration.

The workers are located in the `minotari_payment_processor/src/workers` directory and include:

*   `batch_creator`: Responsible for creating new payment batches from received payments.
*   `unsigned_tx_creator`: Creates unsigned transactions for payment batches by interacting with the Payment Receiver (PR) API.
*   `transaction_signer`: Signs unsigned transactions using the `minotari_console_wallet`.
*   `broadcaster`: Broadcasts signed transactions to the Tari base node.
*   `confirmation_checker`: Checks the confirmation status of broadcasted transactions on the Tari blockchain.
